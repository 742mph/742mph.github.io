                    <p>Cell2D is a free, open-source Java library for making 2D games, designed to simplify and speed up development by handling common organizational tasks. It is based on <a href="https://slick.ninjacave.com/">Slick2D</a>.</p>
                    <p>I was motivated to create Cell2D after I and many other students in my high school AP Computer Science class chose to create video games for our final projects, but not one of our groups completed its respective game by the deadline despite the simplicity of the games' concepts. My group spent a lot of time programming basic event-scheduling and input-processing systems that are common to a lot of games when we could have been working on actual game mechanics, and we still got farther than anyone else, so the other groups likely had the same problem.</p>
                    <p>I created Cell2D in part to help people like those students, who have some programming experience but are newcomers to game development, to get started quickly without reinventing any major wheels first. I also want to make Cell2D well-documented enough to prevent its users from struggling too much with unexpected quirks, as well as provide enough optional low-level control to allow pros to optimize the environment for their specific game.</p>

                    <p>Echo is a free puzzle-platforming video game about multitasking by creating temporary copies of yourself. I created it and spent about 24 hours working on it during the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/fall-reading-week-game-jam-2017">utGDDC Fall Reading Week Jam 2017</a>. A month later, I worked for about 14 more hours on it (yes, I timed myself) over a period of 12 days, for a total of 38 hours of development time.</p>
                    <p>Echo's sound effects were generated with <a href="https://sfbgames.com/chiptone/">ChipTone</a>, and its music was composed by Shaun Bellamy.</p>

                    These are modifications that I've made for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(series)">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> fangame <a href="https://www.srb2.org/">Sonic Robo Blast 2</a>, ranging from extra levels to playable characters to different styles of gameplay using SRB2's engine. Most of them can be accessed through <a href="https://mb.srb2.org/member.php?u=4557">my page</a> on the SRB2 Message Board forum, or by searching for my username on that forum.

                <p>I've made a couple of JavaScript-powered interactive webpages that don't do anything practical, but might be fun to play around with.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>For a high school English assignment, I made <a href="godot.html">a webpage</a> that displays an excerpt from Samuel Beckett's play <i>Waiting for Godot</i>. There's something unusual about it, however...</li>
                    <li>For fun and JavaScript practice one day, I made the <a href="bodyswap.html">Body Swap Simulator</a>. Enter the names of a bunch of people, then pretend to randomly swap their bodies and find out who ended up in whose body. Who's better off? Who's worse off?</li>
