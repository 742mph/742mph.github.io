        This is a game box cover that I made for the classic video game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man_(video_game)">Mega Man</a> as an unofficial replacement for <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/dd/Mega_Man_1_box_artwork.jpg" data-lightbox="Mega Man original cover">the original cover</a>. The character art is official and the background images were only modified by me, but the layout, blurb, and title lettering are all mine.
